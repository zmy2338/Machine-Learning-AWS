        "In this notebook, you will apply everything you have learned to process, explore, and model a dataset collected on penguin species in Antarctica using pandas, matplotlib, and sklearn as well as advanced techniques such as specialized encodings and K-Folds Cross Validation.\n",

        "You will analyze a dataset containing information on the Palmer Archipelago Penguins in Antarctica. In particular, you will wrangle and explore this dataset. You will then train ML models to classify penguins by species and predict their mass. This is real data collected by biologists as part of the [Long Term Ecological Research Network](https://lternet.edu/).\n",
